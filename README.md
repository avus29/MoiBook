# MoiBook
Here is an app that can niftly be used to searh for info about a book/publication.
This app uses the book API by google to return JSON objects from a search query.
The JSON objects are parsed and displayed in a custom layout and thus populated in a custom array adapter.

P.S - I welcome suggestions and criticism, you'd be contributing to my becoming a better developer. Thanks.
